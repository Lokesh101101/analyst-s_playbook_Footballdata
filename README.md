METHODOLOGY:
Data Wrangling: Merged datasets, handled missing values, eliminated duplicates, and stored cleaned data in Excel and SQL formats.
Descriptive Analytics: Examined player performance, team comparisons, attendance trends, referee actions, substitution patterns, and competition statistics using summary statistics and visualizations.
Predictive Modelling: Developed a linear regression model for player market value, a KNN model for match attendance, and a logistic regression model for yellow card prediction.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducted t-tests to compare goal-scoring averages between teams and event occurrence times.
Clustering: Utilized K-Means clustering to group players based on attributes and demographics.
Visualization: Created visualizations in Tableau to represent key findings and trends.

TOOLS : Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), SQL, Tableau, Excel
